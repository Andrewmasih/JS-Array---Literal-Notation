/* literal notation is where you define a new array using just empty brackets. Example */

let myArray = ["stringValues", "numberValues", "multipleValues", 100, 101, 5, (5*10) + 2, "anyValue"]

console.log(myArray);

/* It is the "new" way of defining arrays, and I suppose it is shorter/cleaner. */
